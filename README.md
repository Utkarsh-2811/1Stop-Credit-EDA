# 1Stop-Credit-EDA
# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and understanding a dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. It helps uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data before applying any machine learning. The notebook uses visualizations and summary statistics to bring clarity to the raw data. It also addresses issues like missing values and outliers. The goal is to make the dataset ready for modeling or deeper analysis.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objective 
The primary goal is to analyze the dataset using Python and extract meaningful patterns.
It aims to clean and preprocess the data while identifying key insights.
Ultimately, it prepares the dataset for further predictive modeling or decision-making steps.

# ðŸ›  Steps & Workflow
-Data Loading: Imported the dataset using pandas.
-Initial Exploration: Checked the structure, data types, null values, and descriptive stats.
-Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and detected outliers.
-Univariate Analysis: Plotted individual feature distributions using histograms and boxplots.
-Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between features using scatter plots and heatmaps.
-Insights & Observations: Summarized key patterns found in the data.
