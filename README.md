# 1Stop-Credit-EDA
# 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes why telecom customers are leaving the service (churn). It uses real customer data, statistical methods, and visual dashboards to uncover patterns. Tools like Python (for EDA) and Power BI (for dashboards) are used. The project helps the telecom company understand which users are likely to churn. The ultimate goal is to reduce customer loss through data-driven decisions.

# 🎯 Objective
The aim is to find the key reasons behind customer churn. By identifying high-risk customers and patterns, the company can create targeted strategies. The project also supports proactive decision-making using visual insights.

# 🛠 Steps & Workflow
-Data Cleaning & Preparation – Handled missing values, encoded categories

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Python notebook for visual and statistical exploration

-Dashboard Creation – Power BI used to build a user-friendly interface for churn insights

-Pattern Recognition – Compared churn vs. non-churn behavior

-Insights & Reporting – Summarized in visuals and key findings

# 🔍 Key Findings & Insights
-Month-to-month contract customers are most likely to churn

-High churn seen among customers using fiber internet

-Short-tenure customers with high bills are more likely to leave

-Tech support absence and single-line plans also contribute to churn

-Auto-payment and long contracts reduce churn risk

# ✅ Recommendation
-Offer discounts or incentives for yearly/2-year plans

-Provide better onboarding support in the first few months

-Improve technical and customer service support

-Use churn prediction tools to engage at-risk customers early

# 🚀 Future Work
-Develop a machine learning model for churn prediction

-Include text analysis from customer support or reviews

-Automate churn alerts within CRM systems

-Expand to multi-channel data (calls, chats, app usage)

# 🧾 Conclusion
The project delivers deep insights into customer behavior and churn drivers. It combines data science and business intelligence for clear decision-making. Using Python for analysis and Power BI for visualization makes findings accessible. The telecom company can now take proactive steps to retain customers. Further model building will strengthen predictive capabilities.
